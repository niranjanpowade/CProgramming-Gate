Structures means kind of grouping
Structures are used to store a number of elements of different type unlike array where you can only story same type of elements.
So structures are importatnt in c language

Syntax:- 

struct niru  //Here niru is tag which is optional
{
    int i;
    char name;
}x,y,z;    //Also struct niru x,y,z;

x.i=10;
x.name="Niranjan";
//Here three structures x,y,z are being created


//Now lets see nested structures
struct ex1{
    struct niru a;
    struct niru b;
}

struct ex1 t;               --------------------
                            |  ------  ------  |
                            |  | a  |  |  b |  |  t    so t.a.i=10;
                            |  ------  ------  |
                            ---------------------
